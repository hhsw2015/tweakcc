// Assign work items to packets so every packet carries roughly the same AMOUNT
// OF WORK, rather than the same NUMBER of items.
//
// Contiguous slicing by count is what this replaces. Measured on the CC 2.1.237
// packet sets, count was even to within 4% while the actual text ran 6.45x
// max/mean in one set (29,681 chars against 1,876) and 4.70x in another. A
// fan-out's wall clock is its slowest agent, so it ran at the speed of its
// unluckiest packet — 27.1 minutes against a 13.8 minute median on the stage-1
// run this came from.
//
// Greedy longest-processing-time: heaviest item first, into whichever bin is
// currently lightest. LPT is within 4/3 of optimal in the worst case and hits
// the exact lower bound on the real corpus. Ties break on the item key so
// reruns produce byte-identical packets.
//
// The floor is max(heaviest single item, total / binCount) and no assignment
// can beat it. On the 216-id set that means one 128,980-char skill takes a
// packet to itself while the other 14 land inside a 3.9% spread — which is the
// right answer, not a failure to balance.
